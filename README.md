# Business-Intelligence-for-E-Commerce
Conducting research for a French fashion e-commerce website to predict customer retention and engagement. By analyzing customer behavior and transaction data, I develop models that provide actionable insights to drive business strategy and improve customer loyalty and make important predictions for the future

Main Objective:
The primary objective of this Website User Behaviour Analysis research project for the French C2C fashion store is 
to gain deep insights into the online behaviours and preferences of users engaging with the e-commerce 
platform. Specifically, the aim is to:
1. Understand User Navigation: Explore how users navigate through the website, including the paths 
they take, the pages they visit, and the duration of their sessions.
2. Analyse User Engagement: Examine levels of user engagement by assessing metrics such as time 
spent on site, frequency of visits, and interaction with various features and content.
3. Identify Conversion Drivers: Identify key factors influencing user conversion rates, including 
product views, cart additions, checkout processes, and purchase behaviours.
4. Uncover User Preferences: Unearth user preferences in terms of product categories, styles, brands, 
and price points to inform inventory management and merchandising strategies.
5. Optimize User Experience: Utilize insights gained to optimize website layout, enhance product 
discovery mechanisms, and personalize marketing efforts to better align with user expectations and 
preferences

Context
There are a lot of unknowns when running an E-commerce store, even when you have analytics to guide your decisions.

Users are an important factor in an e-commerce business.
This is especially true in a C2C-oriented store, since they are both the suppliers (by uploading their products) AND the customers (by purchasing other user's articles).

This frech fashion store dataset aims to serve as a benchmark for an e-commerce fashion store. Using this dataset, we may want to try and understand what you can expect of your users and determine in advance how your grows may be.

For instance, if you see that most of your users are not very active, you may look into this dataset to compare your store's performance.
If you think this kind of dataset may be useful or if you liked it, don't forget to show your support or appreciation with an upvote/comment. You may even include how you think this dataset might be of use to you. This way, I will be more aware of specific needs and be able to adapt my datasets to suits more your needs.

This dataset is part of a preview of a much larger dataset. Please contact me for more.
